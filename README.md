DATA CLEANING AND PREPROCESSING

The analysis began with by examining the dataset using Excel to identify any columns with null or missing values. I found that there were no missing values. Focusing on the columns labeled "date" and "ages," I categorized customers into different age groups and determined the months in which products were purchased. This approach allows for a detailed understanding of sales patterns and customer demographics, facilitating more targeted and effective business strategies.

PIVOT TABLE AND DASHBOARD PREPARATION

To understand the relationships between different columns and to thoroughly analyze the store's annual sales, a pivot table was created using Excel. This pivot table enabled a comprehensive examination of sales data. Subsequently, the insights derived from the pivot table were used to prepare a detailed dashboard, providing a clear and concise visualization of the store's performance. This method allows for a deeper understanding of sales trends, customer behavior, and product performance, aiding in more informed decision-making and strategic planning.
